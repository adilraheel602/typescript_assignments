// Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once,
// so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
// This program saves a string in variable and print it after removing all type of white spaces 
// at start and end of the name.
